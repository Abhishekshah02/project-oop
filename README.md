login page and student managemnet system.

Here I have used the basic concept of the OOP and the file handaling to complete this project.

It is basically a login portal of the student and the teacher with student management system.
Here if the student is using it he/she should register first then use the username and passwored to login and if they have forget thie password then they can
search thier account with their username to see the password.After that the page will move to the student mangement system where student can enter the their 
detail, can see the detail of the friends.And if the teacher is using it then they can register and login in the same process and the only teacher has the
access to search the student detail with their roll no.
